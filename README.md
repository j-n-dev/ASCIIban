# Compilation instructions
I only know how to do this in Visual Studio. There could be ways to do this with different environments, but I don't know them.
1. Create a new C# project (make sure it's set to .NET Core 6.0).
2. Paste in all the files.
3. Compile (F6)
4. Copy the `mine.txt`file into the build directory, and copy the `levels` folder into the build directory.
5. You should be able to run it now.
